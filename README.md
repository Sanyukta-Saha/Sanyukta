1. Virtual Cursor  
This project is a computer vision-based system that enables users to control the cursor and interact with web applications using head and eye movements. Developed under the AI club as an individual project, it leverages Python along with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Dlib to track facial landmarks. The system maps head movements to cursor motion and detects eye blinks for click actions, allowing a hands-free computing experience. This technology can benefit individuals with disabilities by providing an alternative to traditional mouse controls.  

2. Face Recognition-Based Attendance System  
This Python-powered attendance system automates student attendance tracking using facial recognition. It employs OpenCV, Dlib, and Face Recognition libraries to detect and recognize student faces from a camera feed. The system compares detected faces with a pre-registered database and marks attendance accordingly. A CSV file is generated daily, storing attendance records with timestamps. This project eliminates manual attendance processes, reducing errors and improving efficiency in educational institutions.  

3. AI Proctoring System  
Designed for online examinations, this AI-powered proctoring system detects cheating behaviors using YOLO, MediaPipe, and PyAudio in Python. It identifies multiple faces to flag unauthorized individuals, detects objects like mobile phones or books, and analyzes voice activity for suspicious sounds. The system processes live video and audio feeds in real-time, providing an efficient way to monitor exams remotely. Optimized video capture ensures smooth performance, while alerts are displayed on the screen when cheating is detected.  

4. Streamlit Application for Data Visualization  
This Python-based Streamlit application allows users to upload CSV files and generate data visualizations dynamically. It supports various plot types, such as bar charts and histograms, making it easier to analyze relationships between numerical and categorical data. The user-friendly interface simplifies data exploration and visualization without requiring extensive programming knowledge.
